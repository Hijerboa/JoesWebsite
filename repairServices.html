                      <p> We use tried and tested software to remove all sorts of malware and viruses from your computer. Our methods ensure that your personal files and data remain intact, while at the same time removing all traces of the virus/malware from your computer. </p>
                      <p> If your computer is currently infected with malware, there is a good chance that it is already spreading to other devices on your network, as well as to your friends and family in your address book. Other malicious programs will remain quiet on your computer, collecting your person information, as well as things like your credit card numbers, passwords, or personal data. In order to help defend you against these sort of threats, we offer Malwarebytes Premium subscriptions at a discounted rate, to best protect you from the makers of this malicious software</p>
                      <p> The most malicious form of malware comes in the form of ransomware. If you find your computer locked with a message telling you to call a number and pay a fee to unlock your files, then you have been infected with ransomware. To best protect yourself from this kind of malware, ensure that you take regular backups of your computer</p>

                        <li>Do you click on a search result and get re-directed to a completely different page?</li>
                        <li>Do you have an "automatic" virus scan coming up on your computer telling you that you need to purchase a lifetime subscription to a software you've never downloaded?</li>
                        <li>Is your computer is acting funny?</li>

                      <p> While many viruses can be removed by our software, some may be incredibly well rooted into your computer, meaning that a full Windows reinstallation (see below) may be necessary to ensure that the virus is fully removed.</p>

                      <p>If your computer is acting slow, and showing its age, one of the best ways to get it up and running like new, is to make it like new. Reinstalling windows will remove all the unnecessary software that has been installed over the years, as well as removes the bits and pieces of software that their uninstallers have left behind. If you remember what your computer felt like when it was brand-new out of box, and you wish to experience that again, this service will give you back that feeling of a brand-new computer.</p>
                      <p>A windows reinstallation is the simplest and most effective way to solve a large variety of issues you may have encountered in your computer usage. Over the years, various drivers, software, and other files build up on your computer, not only filling up the space on your hard drive, but also slowing it down with various unnecessary processes. The most effective way to clean this out is to reinstall Windows, which will get your computer feeling like new once again. </p>
                      <p>Whenever we reinstall your Windows Operating System, we keep a copy of your old hard drive for a minimum of 30 days to ensure that you can access anything on your old hard drive that you may have forgotten that you needed. If you realize that there was something on that old hard drive you still need, even if you did not have us transfer your data from your old computer to your new one, just give us a call and we will be able to obtain your files.</p>
                      <p>Reinstalling Windows often can be done within 48 hours, getting you back up and running as quickly as possible.</p>

                      <p>Transferring all of your personal data from one computer to another can be a very tedious task. Rather than doing it yourself, let our technicians do it for you!</p>
                      <p>We will ensure that all of your personal files are transferred safely from your old computer to your new one, or from your computer to an external hard drive, or from any location to another. Even if your computer won't boot to Windows, we often are able to transfer your files off of your old hard drive and onto a new hard drive in order to recover your files.</p>
                      <p>While we are not a data recovery service, we are often able to recover data from a failing hard drive. If we are not able to recover your data, you will not be charged, and we will transfer you to one of our partners with expertise in data recovery.</p>
                      <p>To ensure your data is transferred properly, and that all of it was saved, we hold your old hard drive for a minimum of 30 days, to allow for the correction of any transfers which did not go as planned. If your drive is failing, it is securely erased, and recycled to ensure that no one can get their hands on your data.</p>

                      <p>Every day, new programs are being developed for our computers, and new programs are increasingly using more and more of our computers' resources. A computer that may once have been snappy years ago, often no will drag on even the most basic applications.</p>
                      <p>One of the best ways to stop your computing experience from dragging is to perform hardware upgrades on your computer. Two of the most effective, as well as cost effective, upgrades are adding more RAM and installing an SSD in your computer.</p>
                      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Adding More RAM:</p>
                      <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is what your computer uses to access files which it is currently using. Since RAM is much faster than your Hard Drive, which stores the bulk of the information on your computer, your computer stores what it is currently using in RAM. However, if what you are trying to do on your computer requires more space than there is available RAM, the computer will be forced to keep this information on your hard drive, which is significantly slower. You will immediately feel when your computer does this. By adding more RAM, you will give your computer more space to store the files it is using, and noticeably speed up your computer.</p>
                      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Adding an SSD:</p>
                      <p>A traditional hard drive is made of spinning magnetic platters. While these platters spin at extremely high speeds, there is a maximum speed these platters can spin, resulting in a limit to how fast your data can be read. SSD's transfer data via electrons, which is significantly  faster. While more expensive per GB than standard Hard Drive's, SSD's will increase the speed of your computing experience drastically. Your machine will boot much faster, often times in mere seconds. Your programs will launch so fast you won't even get a chance to get a cup of coffee. If you chose to upgrade your machine to an SSD, we can either clone your Hard Drive to the new SSD, getting you back up and running without missing a beat, or we can reinstall Windows from scratch (see above) to make your computer feel like new again.</p>
                      <p>No matter what you chose, we will ensure that your computer is up and running again as quickly as possible, and performing better than ever.</p>
