                <p>Buying a computer can be a very confusing process, especially if you are not tech savvy, and don't know what all the terms involved with purchasing a computer mean. More expensive means better performance. But what about if you're looking at two similarly priced computers? Is it worth spending the extra $25? Our guide below will help you decide.</p>
                <p>There are two key questions you should ask yourself when you buy a new computer:</p>
                <p> 1.) What are you planning on using your computer for? </p>
                <p>2.) How much are you looking to spend?</p>
                <p>With these two questions in mind, it will be fairly easy to determine the best possible computer for you.</p>

              <center><h2 style="font-weight: bold;">The Processor</h2>
                <p>Think of the procssor as the "brain" of the computer. The processor of the computer is one of the most vital parts, as it is what actually performs all the operations necessary for your computer to run.</p>
                <p>When looking at a processor, there are three key things to be looking at: what processor brand it is, what the clock speed is, and how many cores it has.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Processor Brand</h3>
                <p>When looking at the processor, one of the most important thing to look at is the brand. There are only two brands used in modern Windows computers: Intel and AMD. Normally, Intel's processors perform slightly better than AMD processors in general everyday tasks. However, if heavily multitasking, such as having many windows open at once, AMD processors tend to perform as well as, and sometimes even slightly better than Intel processors.</p>
                <p>Of course, this is a general guideline, and will not always be true. In the past two years or so, the difference has become much less stark, and there is little difference for the average consumer between an Intel processor and an AMD processor.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Clock Speed</h3>
                <p>A processors clock speed (or just speed) is measured in hertz. One hertz means that the processor can perform one operation per second. Of course, any computer performing only one operation, or even a hundred operations per second, would be incredibly slow. As such, most processors run at a speed of greater than 1 Gigahertz (gHz), meaning greater than a billion operations per second. Because of this, the faster the processor is in gHz, the faster the computer will be able to perform tasks.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Core Count</h3>
                <p>A core of a processor is essentially a mini processor within the processor. Each core can do operations independently of the other. Thus, a quad-core processor with four cores can be doing four operations at once. Because of this, a multi-core processor will perform significantly faster than a single core processor. But will a dual core processor always be twice as fast as a single core processor of the same speed? Unfortunately not. Because not all workloads can take advantage of multicore functionality, even those that are able to don't perform as efficiently as they theoretically can. The operating system has to expend some performance delegating tasks between the cores, which uses a surprising amount of power. Thus, while more cores are defiantly better than less cores, it is not always as fast as it can possibly be.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">The RAM</h2>
                <p>RAM, also referred to as Memory, is where the computer stores files that it currently is using. While the computer stores the vast majority of files on the Hard Drive (see definition below), it stores those that it is currently using and needing to access in the RAM. If there is a file which the computer needs to access, but won't fit in the RAM due to there not being enough RAM remaining, the computer will be forced to access that file directly from the hard drive, which is several orders of magnitude slower.</p>
                <p>The best analogy for this is to imagine you are working on a bunch of files. You have a table that you can spread these files out on, and quickly grab files from when you need them. The files you do not need to access are stored across the room in a file cabinet. Every time you need to access a file you do not have room for on the table, you must trek over to the file cabinet, find it, and pull it out. This is considerably slower than grabbing the file off of your table. The larger the table, the more files you can fit on it, and the more efficient your workflow will be. While it is possible to do this on an incredibly tiny table, it is going to be a painful process to do so.</p>
                <p>Your RAM is like that table, and the hard drive like that file cabinet. The more RAM, the faster your machine will be when you are trying to do 2 or 3 or more things at once.</p>
                <p>For the average person who just wishes to browse the web or type and email, 4GB of RAM is plenty. However, if you wish to multitask and write a paper while watching a video and browsing the web, you're going to need more. 6GB will be enough, but 8GB will give you enough room to do most any task you wish to do. For gamers or power users who wish to have a dozen web tabs open and many heavy programs running at once, 16GB is necessary.</p>
                <p>While 4GB will be enough for the average person, we recommend 8GB to not only allow your computer to feel snappier, but also to give you room for the future, and allow your computer to last longer. Most of our computers can be upgraded from 4GB to 8GB (for a fee) to increase your productivity.</p>

              <center><h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Storage</h2>
                <p>The idea of storage is pretty simple: storage is where your computer stores its files. However, in recent years, there has emerged a question: which type of storage is best for you? There are two types: standard Hard Disk Drives (HDD or HD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). While both perform the same basic function, they do so in two different ways.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Hard Disk Drives</h3>
                <p>HDD's have been around since before many of us. Their operation is pretty simple: a series of magnetic platters are spun at thousands of rotations per minute, and a magnetic arm reads the data off of them. HDD's can be found in capacities as small as 120 GB, and as large as 14 TB, which is 14,000 GB's. Their primary advantage is how inexpensive they can be compared to SSD's, as well as the enormous capacities they can be found in. However, they are considerably slower than SSD's.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Solid State Drives</h3>
                <p>SSD's are a new technology. While HDD's utilize a series of spinning platters to read data, SSD's rely on flash storage, reading and writing data through electrical signals. Electricity is significantly faster than platters, often 5-10 times as fast, meaning that computers with SSD's are much much faster than those with HDD's. A boot time for a machine with an SSD is often under 20 seconds, and the loading of programs is incredibly fast.</p>
                <p>SSD's do have a major downside however: they cost significantly more than a HDD for the same amount of storage. However, for most people, the increased speed in the everyday usage is a worthwhile trade off for losing storage capacity. Adding more storage that is slower is also a fairly easy upgrade.</p>
                <p>External Hard Drives can be found fairly cheaply, and can store your photos and videos which do not fit on an SSD. Most desktop computers can actually fit both a HDD and an SSD, with the operating system and programs being installed on the SSD, and data such as pictures and videos being stored on the HDD. Some laptops also allow for this as well, however then tend to be more expensive.</p>
                <p>For many people, the increased cost of an SSD is worth it. If you find a computer in our shop which does not have an SSD currently installed, we can swap out the HDD currenlty in it (for an additional fee) which will greatly increase the speed of your machine.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Operating System</h2>
                <p>A computer's operating system is the underlying software that other pieces of software run on. The most common is Windows in all its variations (XP, Vista, 7, 8, and most recently, 10). Another common one is MacOS X which runs exclusively on Apple's Mac line of computers. Without your operating system, your computer simply would not run.</p>
                <p>Almost every computer we sell comes preloaded with our custom Windows 10 image, which comes preinstalled with open source (free) office software, Google Chrome, and all of the necessary drivers for your computer. While in past interations of Windows Microsoft has released a large variety of versions of Windows with confusing names such as Home Basic, Home Premium, Pro, Enterprise, and more, in Windows 10 Microsoft has simplified this, and offers only two versions to consumers: Home and Pro.</p>
                <p>For most people, Home will be best option. Home allows for you to not only use Windows and run any program you wish, but also to perform any necessary administration on your computer. Anything that the average personal user would want or to need to do, can be done in Windows 10 Home.</p>
                <p>For users who need more security, and need to have more control over their machine, Windows 10 Pro may be necessary. Windows 10 Pro enables increased security options, which can prevent the computer from booting without a BIOS level password and encrypts your entire hard drive to protect all your data.</p>
                <br />
                <p>There is one more operating system that you should be aware of: ChromeOS, which is only available on Chromebooks. ChromeOS is essentually a bare-bones OS which runs everything out of the Chrome Browser. It is extremely light-weight, and allows for low cost machines which run very quickly with a long battery life. However, everything is down through the Chrome Browser. If all you do is browse the web, send emails, and are comfortable with using Google Docs, and are on a tight budget, then getting a "Chromebook" may be your best option. While we do not always have them in stock, when we do, they are most often under $200, and are very budget friendly--but also useful--machines.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Graphics Cards</h2>
                <p>Graphics cards (also known as Graphics Processing Units, Video Cards, or GPU's), handle the display of data on your screen. Whether that data be a spreadsheet, a website, a game, or an actual video, it is the job of the Graphics Card to display it on the screen. For gamers, a "dedicated" Graphics Card is a must, as most games simply cannot be run smoothly on the Graphics Card "integrated" in to the processor. </p>
                <p>So what is a dedicated video card vs. an integrated one? On every computer, the processor has a sort of "built in" video card that is able to handle basic tasks, such as displaying websites or videos. These are perfectly fine for many users, however for those who wish to play games, the integrated graphics simply will not cut it. Why? That's because your processor is very good at performing algebraic tasks, involving numbers, but not so good at geometric tasks, involving shapes. The Graphics Card on the other hand is very good with shapes, but not so good with numbers, meaning that it is excellent for displaying the complex and detailed scenes in modern games.</p>
                <p>Unless you are a gamer, or someone who must run heavy weight programs (such as CAD programs), then you most likely will not need a dedicated Graphics Card in your computer, and would be much better served spending your money on enhancing other aspects of your computer, such as adding more RAM or an SSD. </p>
