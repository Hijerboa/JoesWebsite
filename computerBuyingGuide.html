                <p style="font-size: 16px;">Buying a computer can be a very confusing process, especially if you aren't tech savvy, and don't know what all the terms involved with the purchasing of a computer mean. Obviously more expensive is better, but what about if you're looking at two similarly priced computers? Is it worth spending the extra $25? That's where this guide can help you decide.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">There are two key questions you should ask yourself when you buy a new computer: 1.) What are you planning on using your computer for? and 2.) How much are you looking to spend?</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">With these two questions in mind, it will be fairly easy to determine the best possible computer for you.</p>

              <center><h2 style="font-weight: bold;">The Processor</h2>
                <p>When you hear of the "brain" of the computer, the processor is what is being referred to. The processor of the computer is arguably the most vital part of any computer, as it is what actually performs all the operations necessary for your computer to run</p>
                <p>When looking at a processor, there are three key things to be looking at: what processor it actually is, what the clock speed is, and how many cores it has.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Processor Name</h3>
                <p>When looking at the name of the processor, the most important thing to look at is the brand. There are only two brands used in modern Windows computers: Intel and AMD. Generally, Intel's processors perform slightly better than AMD processors in general everyday tasks, but when multitasking heavily, such as having many windows open at once, AMD processors tend to perform as well as, and sometimes even slightly better than Intel processors.</p>
                <p>Of course, this is a general guideline, and will not always be true: in the past two years or so, the difference has become much less stark, and there is little difference for the average consumer between and AMD processor and an Intel processor.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Clock Speed</h3>
                <p>A processors clock speed (or just speed) is measured in hertz. One hertz means that the processor can perform one operation per second. Of course, any computer performing only one operation, or even a hundred operations per second, would be incredibly slow. As such, most processors run at a speed of greater than 1 Gigahertz (gHz), meaning greater than a billion operations per second. As such, the faster the processor is in gHz, the faster the computer will be able to perform tasks.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Core Count</h3>
                <p>A core of a processor is essentially a mini processor within the processor. Each core can do operations independently of the other. Thus, a quad-core processor with four cores can be doing four operations at once. Thus, a multi-core processor will perform significantly faster than a single core processor. But will a dual core processor always be twice as fast as a single processor of the same speed? Unfortunately, not. Due to the fact that not all workloads can take advantage of multicore functionality. Even those that are able to don't perform as efficiently as the theoretically can: the operating system has to expend some performance delegating tasks between the cores, which uses a surprising amount of power. Thus, while more cores are defiantly better than less cores, it is not always as fast as it can possibly be.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">The RAM</h2>
                <p>RAM, also referred to as Memory, is the computer stores files that it currently is using. While the computer stores the vast majority of files on the Hard Drive (see below), it stores those that is currently using and needing to access in the RAM. If there is file which the computer needs to access, but won't fit in the RAM due to there not being enough RAM remaining, the computer will be forced to access that file directly from the hard drive, which is several orders of magnitude slower.</p>
                <p>The best analogy for this is to imagine you are working on a bunch of files. You have a table that you can spread these files out on, and quickly grab files from when you need them. The files you do not need to access are stored across the room in a file cabinet. Every time you need access a file you do not have room for on the table, you must trek over to the file cabinet, find it, and pull it out. This is considerably slower than grabbing the file off of your table. The larger the table, the more files you can fit on it, and the more efficient your workflow will be. While it is possible to do this on a table the size of a single sheet of paper, it is going to be a painful process to do so.</p>
                <p>Your RAM is like that table, and the hard drive like that file cabinet. The more RAM, the faster your machine will feel when you are trying to do 2 or 3 or more things at once.</p>
                <p>For the average person who just wishes to browse the web or type and email, 4GB of RAM is plenty. However, if you wish to multitask and write a paper while watching a video and browsing the web, you're going to need more. 6GB will be enough, but 8GB will give you enough head room to do most any task you wish to do. For gamers or power users who wish to have a dozen web tabs open and many heavy programs running at once, 16GB is necessary.</p>
                <p>While 4GB will be enough for the average person, we recommend 8GB to not only allow your computer to feel snappier, but also to give you headroom for the future, and allow your computer to last longer. Most of our computers can be upgraded from 4GB to 8GB for a fee to increase your productivity.</p>

              <center><h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Storage</h2>
                <p>The idea of storage is pretty simple: it's where your computer stores its files. However, in recent years, there has emerged a question: which type of storage is best for you. There are two types: standard Hard Disk Drives (HDD or HD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). While both perform the same basic function, they do so in two different ways.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Hard Disk Drives</h3>
                <p>HDD's have been around since before many of us. Their operation is pretty simple: a series of magnetic platters are spun at thousands of rotations per minute, and a magnetic arm reads the data off of them. HDD's can be found in capacities as small as 120 GB, and as large as 14TB, which is 14,000 GB's. Their primary advantage is how cheap they can be compared to SSD's, as well as the gigantic capacities they can be found in. However, they are considerably slower than SSD's.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Solid State Drives</h3>
                <p>SSD's are a new technology. While HDD's utilize a series of spinning platters to read data, SSD's rely on flash storage, reading and writing data through electrical signals. Electricity is significantly faster than platters, often 5-10 times as fast, meaning that computers with SSD's are much much faster than those with HDD's. A boot time for a machine with an SSD is often under 20 seconds, and the loading of programs is incredibly fast.</p>
                <p>SSD's do have a major downside however: they cost significantly more than a HDD for the same amount of storage. However, for most people, the increased speed in the everyday usage is a worthwhile trade off for losing storage capacity. Adding more storage that is slower is also a fairly easy upgrade. External Hard Drives can abe found fairly cheaply, and can store your photos and videos which do not fit on an SSD. Most desktop computers can actually fit both a HDD and an SSD, with the operating system and programs being installed on the SSD, and data such as pictures and videos being stored on the HDD. Some laptops also allow for this as well, however then tend to be more expensive.</p>
                <p>For many people, the increased cost of an SSD is worth it. If you find a computer in our shop which does not have an SSD currently installed, we can swap out the HDD currenlty in it for an additional fee, which will greatly increase the speed of your machine.</p>

                <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Windows Version</h2>
                <p>Every computer we sell comes preloaded with our custom windows 10 image, which comes preinstalled with office software, google chrome, and all of the necessary drivers for you computer. While in past interations of Windows Microsoft has released a large variety of versions of Windows with confusing names such as Home Basic, Home Premium, Pro, Enterprise, and more, in Windows 10 Microsoft has simplified this, and offers only two versions to consumers: Home and Pro.</p>
                <p>For most people, Home will be best option. Home allows for you to not only use Windows and run any program you wish, but also to perform any necessary administration on your computer. Anything that the average personal user would want to need to do, can be done in Windows 10 Home.</p>
                <p>For users who need more security, and need to have more control over their machine, then Windows 10 Pro may be necessary. Windows 10 Pro enables increased security options, which can prevent the computer from booting without a BIOS level password and encrypts your entire hard drive to protect all your data.</p>
